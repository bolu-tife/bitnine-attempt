# Fibonacci

## Development Environment
The program is implemented in C and uses standard C libraries. To compile and run the program, you'll need:

- GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) or any other C compiler
- Standard C libraries

## How to Compile and Run the Source Code

1. Clone the repository or download the source code files:
git clone https://github.com/bolu-tife/bitnine-attempt.git

2. Change to Q1 in the project directory: 

3. Compile the source files:
`make build`

The above command compiles all the C source files and links them into an executable named `c`.

4. Run the executable:
`make run`


5. To run test:
`make test`


The program will evaluate the arithmetic operations and Fibonacci sequence based on the given expressions and print the results.

## Sample Output
ADD: 16
MUL: 20
SUB: -4
FIBO: 2
FIBO: 2
